#NorseMC

The very first version of NorseMC, the first mod in the RiordanMC Series.

This one contains Mjolnir. Have fun!

Mod Features:<br>
Mjolnir (Thor's Hammer): Call down lightning and explosions! Right click for lightning, Left click for one-shot.<br>
Bottle of Blood: Drops when a player dies. Currently has no use.

This mod is still in Beta, so may have some bugs.

Credits:<br>
Rick Riordan, for making the Magnus Chase books.<br>
Gifted Goose, for inspiring and helping me with the features.<br>
Aidan Riverstone (me), for making it.
